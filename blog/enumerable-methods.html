    	<strong>Enumeration</strong>, <strong>enumerator</strong>, andÂ <strong>enumerable</strong> are terms I encounter again and again as I search the web for solution to my coding challenges. I'm getting better at searching the Ruby documentation for enumerables to use in my code, but I confess that I couldn't clearly define what they are; at least until I decided to write this post.</p>

		<p>As with most specialized concepts it will help to define another concept before wading into the terms at hand. A coding program is like a tower made of legos, with each lego block containing information about the tower as a whole. Each of those lego blocks is a module, and modules contain instructions that will help the program run for beginning to end and return the desired output.</p>

		<p>To <strong>enumerate</strong> is to list, to mention things one by one. <strong>Enumeration</strong> is the act of enumerating.</p>

		<p>An <strong>enumerator</strong> object is the tool that iterates over a list and returns an output.</p>

		<p><strong>Enumerables</strong> are built-in methods (read: part of the Ruby programming language) that can be used throughout the modules to execute different functions. I think of them as a shortcut I can take thanks to the creators of Ruby. I don't have to figure out how to break down the steps necessary for the computer to sort an array in alphabetical order, I can use .sort for that.</p>
