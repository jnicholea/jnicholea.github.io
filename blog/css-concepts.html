<h1>Thinking of Margin/Border/Padding as Images on a Wall</h1>

        <p>Imagine a completely blank webpage. Place an image of an adorable baby make a sour face upon first tasting a lemon. Adorable! Except your image feels like it's clinging to the upper left corner of your page and you'd like to give it some space to breathe. And you also notice that it looks a little flat and could benefit from having a lime green border to offset the lemon yellow in the photos.</p>

        <p>Once you have your puckering baby surrounded by a lime green border should you change the dimensions of the margin, border, or padding to make your desired changes? I found the answer to this question clicked for me when I started each element on the page as a framed and matted image on a wall. All websites can be thought of as an arrangement of square containers, often referred to as divs. The edges of the wall below represents the div or container that the element is sitting inside.</p>

        <p><strong>1</strong> = <em>Margin</em>. The space between the edge of the wall and element is the margin.
        <br>

        <strong>2</strong> = <em>Border</em>. The white wooden frame seen below is the border between the margin and the padding.
        <br>

        <strong>3</strong> = <em>Padding</em>. Inside of the border is the off-white thick paper used as a mat. It gives some nice breathing room between the border and the actual content.
        <br>

        <strong>4</strong> = <em>Content</em>. In the visual example below the content is a reproduction of a painting. On the web it can be an image or text.</p>

        <p>When making changes to elements on your site and trying to decide whether to change the border, padding, or margin, think about exactly what you're trying to change. Using the image on the wall above...</p>

        <p>Do you want the image+mat+frame to stay the same, but you want the image to be closer to or farther from the edge of the wall? Change the margin.</p>

        <p>Do you like where the image+mat sit on the wall but want a thick pumpkin-orange border around the image and the mat? Change the border color and size.</p>

        <p>Do you want more breathing room between your image and your border? (A larger mat?) Change your padding.</p>

        <p>CSS placement can be tricky, and changing the above parameters might not put your logo or title or navigation bar quite where you'd like it to go. Your website is a series of boxes next to boxes inside boxes (divs) and there are a variety of factors that can affect how your website looks and where things go. But when you're thinking about one element, and the div it sits inside, and the way your element is placed within that div, changing the margin, border, and padding should get your content looking the way you desire it to.</p>
