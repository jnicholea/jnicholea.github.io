  <h1>Taking Ownership of the Dev Bootcamp Experience</h1>

      I signed up for <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">Dev Bootcamp</a> specifically because of the phase-based program structure with an emphasis on developing the <a href="http://psychcentral.com/lib/what-is-emotional-intelligence-eq/">EQ</a> of an individual along with their <a href="http://www.quora.com/How-do-I-increase-my-IQ-1">IQ</a>. The phase-based program allows me the space I need to really learn the material, instead of forcing myself to rush in order to meet all of the deadlines. Of course my goal is to finish the program the week before Christmas and move into a new chapter of my life in the first week of 2016, but it is very important to me that I graudate the program after soaking up as much as possible before the technical interviews and the new job training begins. I've been passionate about the growth mindset after reading <a href="http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/salman-khan/the-one-world-schoolhouse/9781455508372/">The One World Schoolhouse</a> and am excited to be a part of a learning environment where the capacity to learn is emphasized as robustly as the curriculum.

        <a href="https://vimeo.com/85001014">Shereef's Fireside Chat</a> clarified some of my assumptions and further reinforced that this program is the right choice for me. One week in and I'm already scrambling a bit to make furthter adjustments in my life to accomodate the workload of Phase 0. I've been a work-at-home-mom for over five years now, and there are a lot of things I'm going to need to adjust about my schedule and mindset in order to manage the demands of my future job. Phase 0 is not only preparing me for Phase 1, 2, and 3 of the DBC program, but also is providing me a glimpse into what my work-life balance is going to be like after DBC graduation. Attending a program without something like the Phase 0 ramp-up period and the Phase 1/2/3 holistic approach to developing a person instead of just a programmer would have been a recipe for mental/emotional collapse for me.

        I most appreciated the frank talk about a student's employment prospects post-graduation. Becoming employable is as important as the amount of programming skills a student absorbs, and employability and a firm grasp of a wide-variety of programming principles are not always the same thing. I was already approaching the program with a growth-mindset, but now I'll be striving to focus less on checking the "completion" box for each assignment, and more on developing the unique skillset I can take from this intense experience and leverage into a choice employment opportunity in January 2016.
