This was the week in the Dev Bootcamp curriculum where the materials switched from focusing on Ruby to teaching us about Javascript. It was rough to move from a place where I was just starting to feel comfortable, to a new language that elicits groans from a majority of users who try to wade into its murky depths.

While struggling with one function and for-loop after another, I started looking around for a resource that would help me understand why my Javascript code wasn't working the way I expected. That's when I found <a href ="http://jshint.com/">JSHint</a>, a Javascript quality code tool.

JSHint is incredibly easy to use, and even complete beginners can get a lot out of it. Paste your Javascript code into the screen on the lefthand side and on the right side of the screen you will find information about what is contained in the code, as well as a list of warnings if the code has errors or strays outside the bounds of normal Javascript conventions.

JSHint has helped me clean up my code along with debugging that has untagled why a particular piece of code isn't performing as expected.
