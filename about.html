    My first job for someone other than my parents was driving tractor in the cherry orchards, and my first entreuprenerial effort was a pumpkin patch located in the field in front of my parent's house. My father's parents are ranchers, my mother's parents own a dairy, and my parents have built their farm out to include a produce packing shed and drip irrigation distribution business.

    I was the first in my direct family line to graduate from college and I put my English major to use by turning my writing into profits through blogging. I launched Jenna Cole Photography in 2009 and have photographed several dozen weddings and many dozens of portrait sessions since.

    In 2015 I was accepted to Dev Bootcamp where I will add web development to my skillset. After 5+ years of being self-employed while caring for two children I'm looking forward to working full-time in the world of tech where I can marry my aesthetic eye, idiomatic writing style, and blossoming web development skills.
