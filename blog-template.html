<!-- I found it easiest when we verbally agreed on a wireframe template and then one of used a program we were familiar with to quickly sketch out a basic look for the site. It was helpful to decide on a look before we started wireframing so the process went very fast. -->
<!-- It made it very fast to write out the HTML because we had a visual representation of what came next -->
<!-- For this challenge specifically, something very simple that mimics a lot of basic blogs we've seen. Header, navigation menu, body of text, footer. For longer-term projects we would have integrated a discussion about who our users are and how we hope they will navigate our content in with our wireframe discussion. -->
<!-- I tried useing the article tag nested inside of a main class for the first time, I'm curious to see how that affects the way content is displayed as I add and build upon this basic template. -->
